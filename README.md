BEING VERY HONEST I DO NOT DO WELL AT INTERVIEWING
MOST ESPECIALLY WHEN ASKED TO WRITE CODE
RESPONDING UNDER PRESSURE ON THE JOB IS FAR DIFFERENT
THAN TRYING TO RESPOND UNDER PRESSURE WHEN YOU
ARE JUST HOPING YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO GET THE JOB

I DECIDED TO PICK A FEW PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN TO ME TO CODE IN DIFFERENT INTERVIEWS OVER THE YEARS

THERE IS CODE THAT IS COMMENTED OUT WHICH IS CODE 
I FOUND ONLINE IN FORUMS YOU CAN SEE I GENERALLY 
DID NOT USE ANY OF IT AND IN FACT ONE I GOT FROM COPILOT
THE CODE WAS GOOD BUT MY INTENTION FROM THE BEGINNING
WAS TO ONLY LOOK ONLINE OR AI TO TAKE SOME IDEAS FROM THOSE SOURCES

MY VERSION SAVED ABOUT 30 LINES OF CODE
IN ANOTHER CASE WHAT I FOUND ONLINE THAT HAD RECEIVED THE CHECK MARK
USED ~27 LINES OF CODE AND WHAT I DID ONLY USED ~10 LINES OF CODE

I CAN MAKE A GREAT IMPACT ON ANY TEAM I WORK WITH AND PERSONALLY I SETTLE FOR NOTHING LESS
